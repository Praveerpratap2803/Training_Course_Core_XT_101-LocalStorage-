10. Define an interface IClock with type ('digital' | 'analog'), and a time property (an object) with
properties - hours, minutes, seconds (all numbers). Your interface also defines a method
setTime( hours, minutes, seconds ) that sets the time, and getTime() that returns a string
representation of the time. Create 2 objects of IClock type - one of type 'digital' and other of
type 'analog', set the time through setTime() and log the time using getTime().
